# Test Driven Development: Bubble Sort

I mostly write tests only after writing code, but I'd like to be better at using tests as an entry point to development. In this little code exercise I'm implementing bubble sort by first writing the tests that describe the bubble sort functionality.

I'm using Jasmine as a testing framework.
